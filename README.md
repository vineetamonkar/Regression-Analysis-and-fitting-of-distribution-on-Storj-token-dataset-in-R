# Regression-Analysis-and-fitting-of-distribution-on-Storj-token-dataset-in-R
## Abstract 
The aim of the project is to implement different statistical methods on the Storj Token transaction data.The results of the methods are analyzed to derive inferences about the token data.In 4.1, we found how many times a user buys or sells the STORJ token, then fit a distribution and estimate the best distribution.In 4.2, we find the correlation between the STORJ Token price data and layer features of the STORJ Token.In 4.3, we find the most active buyer and seller of our STORJ token and then track them in all other tokens, plot how many unique tokens have they invested in the provided time frame then fit and estimate distributions as part 1. In 4.4, we created  a multiple linear regression model to explain price return on day t.
